# 🗣️ Verbal Ability Grading and Assessment System (VAGAS)

### 🎯 Overview
**VAGAS (Verbal Ability Grading and Assessment System)** is an AI-driven tool designed to **assess and enhance verbal communication skills** through **speech-based evaluation**.  
It analyzes user responses and provides **quantitative scores** and **qualitative feedback** across key language skill dimensions such as vocabulary, grammar, fluency, pronunciation, and comprehension.

This project aims to help students and professionals **improve spoken English** proficiency through automated, data-driven insights — similar to standardized language tests like **IELTS** or **TOEFL**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 **Speech Recognition** – Converts spoken input to text using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).
- 🧠 **Text & Audio Analysis** – NLP techniques for linguistic accuracy + phonetic analysis for pronunciation.
- 📊 **Automated Scoring System** – Evaluates users on vocabulary, grammar, coherence, fluency, and pronunciation.
- 💬 **Feedback Generation** – Provides constructive feedback and tips for improvement.
- 🌐 **Interactive Interface** – Simple GUI or web interface for recording and viewing results.
- 🧾 **User Report Generation** – Generates overall and component-wise verbal ability scores.
